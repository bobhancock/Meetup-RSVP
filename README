As an organizer of a Meetup, I frequently have to supply a list of attendess to building security.  
There is no menu choice on a Meetup for this, so I wrote this program to:

-   find the next Meetup,
-   fetch all the "YES" RSVP responses
-   upload the attendess's first and last names to Google Docs spreadsheet
-   share the spreadsheet with, for example, building security, a co-organizer, etc.


Reuqired Modules
------------------
A minimum of Python 2.6.

Google GDATA Python Client - http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

httplib2 - http://code.google.com/p/httplib2

Joe Gregorio's remarkable module that takes the pain out of HTTP.  This will
be required by the Googel GDATA Python client from version 3.0 onward.

Installation
-------------
Place get_meetup_rsvp.py and settings.py in the same directory.

Execution
----------
Update the values in settings.py so that they are specific to you and your group.

python ./get_meetup_rsvp.py

Notes
-------
This version is written to be run from the command line.  In future, I'll modify it 
so that it can be run as a cron job with and audit log.
