As an organizer of a Meetup, I frequently have to supply a list of attendees to building security.  
There is no menu choice on a Meetup for this, so I wrote this program to:

-   find the next Meetup,
-   fetch all the "YES" RSVP responses
-   upload the attendess's first and last names to a Google Docs spreadsheet
-   share the spreadsheet with, for example, building security, a co-organizer, etc.


Reuqired Modules
------------------
A minimum of Python 2.7.

Google Drive Python SDK - https://developers.google.com/drive/

Installation
-------------
Install the Google Drive SDK.

Place get_meetup_rsvp.py and settings.py in the same directory.

Execution
----------
Update the values in settings.py so that they are specific to you and your group.

python ./get_meetup_rsvp.py

Notes
-------
This version is written to be run from the command line.  The current OAuth2 mechanism
requires human interaction. I'll try to use mechanize to automate this portion.
